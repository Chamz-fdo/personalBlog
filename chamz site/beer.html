            <h2>The Flex.</h2><br>
            <p>  
                On the acting front, Baldoni is best known for playing "Rafael" on 
                The CW's award-winning phenomenon, Jane the Virgin. The fifth and final season is currently airing.
                
                As an entrepreneur, Baldoni co-founded Wayfarer Entertainment-a 
                cause-driven media studio focused on creating content that highlights inspiration,
                 unity, and the power of human connection. Through this platform, he created the dinner 
                 s, Man Enough, which dives into traditional masculinity while focusing on topics like body image,
                 therhood. He has spoken about his own journey with masculinity in a viral TED talk as well as 
                 across college campuses in America.
                
                Baldoni founded and is a chairman of The Wayfarer Foundation, a 
                non-profit organization that puts on one of Los Angeles' largest volunteer events-The Carnival 
                of Love-which provides connection, services, and resources to people who are experiencing 
                homelessness in LA's Skid Row community and will expand nationally in 2020.
                
                Baldoni currently lives in Los Angeles with his wife and two
                 children.</p><br><br>

                We appreciate and honour the trust our clients put into our hands.Pure emotions, laughter,
                tears… We truly believe the greatest pictures are created the same way as falling in
                love – naturally.And there is a reason why we call photos “visual timestamps”.
                We care about heritage and legacy –
                something that can be passed on through time to other generations.</p> <br><br><br>

        <h2>Ted Talks.</h2><br>
        <p>  TED talks have been around for decades. I am person to get excited when
             Netflix releases multiple seasons of favourite TV show, just imagine how 
             many hours of binging content you could have with TED talks. Ted talks can 
             relax and enjoy meaningful presentations while distracting myself after a long day. 
             Not to mention these free little media slices are easy to fit into my routine. 
             Watching TED talks will not only give me a motivational boost while studying, 
             it could also inspire anyones next career move. Better than that, it could help 
             me to improve interview techniques and confidence in meetings helping advance 
             my career once you get your foot in the door. Watching successful or inspired ideas, 
             projects and solutions from the people that created or executed them, in very
              different fields, gives me different perspectives that i can apply . It helps me to 
              make connections, and that’s basically what creativity is.</p><br><br>
